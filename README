pybotwar is a fun and educational game where players
create computer programs to control simulated robots
to compete in a battle arena.

pybotwar was inspired by the game RobotWar that existed
for the Apple ][ in the early 1980s. However, the method
of coding is more akin to the style of programs used
for the FIRST robotics competition, where a particular
user-defined method is called repeatedly (60 times
per second in this case) and must finish in a set
amount of time to avoid putting the robot in to an
error state and disabling it.

Robot programs run in a separate process from the
main simulation, and communicate over standard input
and standard output channels. Theoretically, this
means that the robots could be limited in the amount
of system access they have, and how much of the
system's resources they can consume.

CAUTION!
Right now, that is not the case. Robot programs run
as regular Python programs, using the regular Python
interpreter, and can do anything any other program
can do.

In the future, I intend to implement some kind of
sandboxing for robot programs, but that is not done.


pybotwar uses pybox2d for the physical simulation,
and uses pygame and pygsear for the visualization.
