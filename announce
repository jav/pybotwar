The focus of this release is updating to use the
latest available pybox2d version: 2.3b0

pybotwar uses pybox2d for the physical simulation.
It can be run in text-only mode -- useful for longer
tournaments -- or use pyqt or pygame for a graphical
interface and visualization of the action.

pybotwar is released under GPLv3.
