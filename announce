pybotwar uses pybox2d for the physical simulation,
and uses pygame and pygsear for the visualization.

pybotwar is released under GPLv3.

    - added display of robot status
    - added configuration file for easier testing of various options
        - remove / don't remove dead robots
        - robot max health
        - physics values (force, torque, mass, bullet speed)
    - added non graphics mode (for much faster resolution of battles)
    - fixed cannon heating going below zero
