pybotwar is a fun and educational game where players
create computer programs to control simulated robots
to compete in a battle arena.

pybotwar uses pybox2d for the physical simulation,
and uses either pygame and pygsear or PyQt4 for the
visualization.

pybotwar is released under GPLv3.


Changes in pybotwar-0.7:
    - decouple view modules so pygame not needed if using pyqt
